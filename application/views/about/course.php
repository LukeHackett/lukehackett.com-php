      <p>Computer software is used in a huge variety of situations, from 
        small on-chip programs to large distributed systems; from supporting 
        commercial activities such as banking and e-commerce, through use 
        in government and voluntary organisations, to the control of 
        manufacturing processes, and software for educational and personal 
        use.</p>
        
      <p>Software development is the art of finding practical solutions to 
        real problems. Professional software developers should be able to 
        produce software that is robust, reliable and attractive to use, and 
        should be able to produce this software at reasonable cost and in a 
        reasonable time.</p>
        
      <p>A successful software developer requires a set of core knowledge 
        and skills, and the ability to adapt to changes in a rapidly 
        expanding field. This course will teach you that core knowledge, 
        and develop in you those core skills. You will also learn the methods 
        and techniques current in software development, and develop the 
        flexibility and adaptability required for a long term career in 
        the software development industry.</p>
